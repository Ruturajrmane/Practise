Different apporaches are avialble for the time series forecasting 
1) Pure stastical approach
2) Hybrid approach where ML model is combined with the stastical model
ML/TS combination approaches started infiltrating the domain withgreat success, showing promising results by using the outputs of statistical engines as features
3) Pure DL model

The problem with the DL model is that the results are note interpretable as like classical models
Majorly Time series conisist of Trend and Seasonality component, which are decomposed by the stastical models

NBEATS - Neural basis expansion analysis for interpratable time series forecasting

Architecture - 
Input ---- >> FC 4 layers ---->> gives out the Q expansion coefficient for backcast and forecast ---->> It is fed to the gf and gb
In case of generic model this gf and gb are linear projection with learnable parameters such as forecast = y = VQ + B
But the results of the generic models are not interpretable

To make it iterpretable
Trend model --- g is the polynomial of small degree like 2 or 3
so, y = Q*T   ... T to the power p (p to be 2 or 3)
Seasonality model fourier series function is used

In this architecture there will be two stacks one for trend and one for the seasonality each will have the 3 basic blocks

Residual networking is Previous block removes the portion of the signal bx`âˆ’1 that
it can approximate well, making the forecast job of the downstream blocks easier

We found that ensembling is a much more powerful regularization techniquethan the popular alternatives, e.g. dropout or L2-norm penalty.
