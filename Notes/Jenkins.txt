1) Scripted syntax
2) Declarative pipeline
pipeline {
	agent any
	stages {
		stage ('Hello'){
		steps{
			}}
		}
	}
pipeline {
    agent any ---- instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor
    stages {
        stage('Stage 1') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello world!' ---- writes simple string in the console output
            }
        }
    }
}

Jenkinsfile is where the pipeline is written and it can be saved to the SCM (Source code monitoring) ex - github
Pipeline can be created in following three ways
1) Through blue ocean 
2) Through classic UI - File will be stored in jenkins home directory
3) In SCM - we can write the jenkinsfile manually and commit it to repo from where it will be fetched and build
Jenkins can then check out your Jenkinsfile from source control as part of your Pipeline projectâ€™s build process and then proceed to execute your Pipeline.

a) From definination option chose pipeline script from scm option

Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}

Build ----
Typically this stage of the Pipeline will be where source code is assembled, compiled, or packaged.
